# MECVision
The MEC Vision web-app is a Progressive Web App ([PWA]) prototype coding project that uses computer vision (object detection in this case) on mosquito trap papers (ovitraps) to estimate the number of mosquito eggs on that ovitrap, using computer vision.

This project uses [OpenCV.js], [Vue.js], [Vuetify], and [Vue Croppa] technologies, and used the [TodoMVC] PWA as a template for its codebase.

This project was largely funded through the ZAP program of USAID.
